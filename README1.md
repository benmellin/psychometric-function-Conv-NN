# Psychometric Function Convolutional Neural Network
- In this project, I will train a convolutional neural network on Gaussian noise with horizontal or vertical lines.
- The neural network will learn to classify the Gaussian noise based on whether they have horizontal or vertical lines.
- Then, I will give the trained network Gaussian noise with lines that are not perfectly horizontal or vertical, and see how the network does.
- This is my unique solution to a problem from Mike X Cohen's a Deep Understanding of Deep Learning Course.
- Much of the code is adapted from this course.
